Yes, it's yet another export layers script! This one is mainly targeted for video editing applications. I wrote it because all the other scripts weren't good enough for my purposes. Script is located in File/Export Layers...

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can name output files based on frame counter (i.e. "frame_000.png", "frame_001.png" and so on)
<li>Can export only visible or only linked layers
<li>Correctly exports layers with layer masks
<li>Can export top to bottom or bottom to top
<li>Can resample to different frame rate (and understands frame delay modifiers i.e. "(NNms)")
<li>Can also interpolate frames when resampling
</ul>

This script was used to produce the award winning short film "Stretch Those Glutes (ANNIVERSARY EDITION!)"

<h2>Options description</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Output directory</strong> - select a directory where to export the files
<li><strong>Filename format</strong> - describes how each layer will be named when it's exported. You can use several formatting directives: "%n" inserts image name (usually the filename), "%l" inserts layer name (don't use this with resampling enabled), "%i" inserts the current counter value. You can pad it with zeros so that all numbers have identical width. For example "%3i" will produce "000", "001", "002" and so on. The default filename format uses "%6i" which produces image sequences to be imported in Sony Vegas NLE. Make sure your filename has an extension.
<li><strong>Walk direction</strong> - the direction in which the layers are processed. This mostly affects the counter.
<li><strong>Count offset</strong> - what number do we start counting from
<li><strong>Filter</strong> - allows to export only visible or only linked layers
<li><strong>Resample mode</strong> - when Off, it just exports the layers. However when "No interpolation" or "Use interpolation" is selected, it resamples layers to a fixed framerate. By default a layer is assumed to last 100ms, which can be changed by assigning a delay to a layer via adding "(XXXms)" to its name. When exported with resampling, each file represents a fixed amount of time, which is set by <strong>Frame rate</strong> option. For each of these periods of time, a layer is chosen to represent it. When "Use interpolation" is selected, it might sometimes select two layers and average them to produce a transition.
<li><strong>Interpolation threshold</strong> - when Resample mode is "Use interpolation", this option prevents interpolating when only a small part of layer fits into a frame. For example: 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/pVRpVSr.png"></img>
If y is less than interpolation threshold, layer 1 will be used for frame 2 without interpolation. Otherwise, frame 2 will be an interpolation of layer 1 and layer 2.
</li>
</ul>
